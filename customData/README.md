## apple-drive-duck
This dataset contains pictures of apples, hard drives and rubber ducks. 
Those objects were chosen according to ImageNet strengths and weaknesses. 
ImageNet has a lot of pictures of apples (24 categories with thousands of images each), 
very few hard drive images (68 total) and zero rubber ducks. 
This should give a good variety to study how Transfer Learning behaves with new classes.

The set contains 551 rubber duck images (plus 155 for test),  342 hard drive images (plus 161 for test) and 537 apple images (plus 126 for test). 
For the sampled video data we used one hard drive, 2 different apples (a granny smith and a red delicious) and 2 rubber ducks (one red, one yellow).
